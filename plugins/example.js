// example plugin for the ft-to-inv tool
/* 
   here's some expected usage:
    register a plugin with a name, description, and version
    you can add other metadata, but it won't be used
    for example:
    {
      name: "example-plugin",
      description: "An example plugin",
      version: "1.0.0",
      author: "Your Name",
      hooks: ["beforeMain", "beforeSync", "afterSync"]
    }
      the full list of hooks is:
      beforeMain,
      duringMain,
      afterMain,
      beforeSync,
      duringSync,
      afterSync,

    duringMain triggers in the middle of bootstrap.
    duringSync triggers right after diffs are calculated.

    please add your plugin name to any console output, see below
    if you need more data i'd be happy to help, just open an issue on the repo
    https://github.com/riki-pedia/ft-to-inv/issues
