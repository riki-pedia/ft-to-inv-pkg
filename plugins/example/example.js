// example plugin for the ft-to-inv tool
// shows how plugins work
// at least 50% comments at this point
/* 
   here's some expected usage:
    register a plugin with a name, description, and version
    you can add other metadata, but it won't be used
    for example:
    {
      name: "example-plugin",
      description: "An example plugin",
      version: "1.0.0",
      author: "Your Name",
      hooks: ["beforeMain", "beforeSync", "afterSync"]
    }
      the full list of hooks is:
      beforeMain,
      duringMain,
      afterMain,
      beforeSync,
      duringSync,
      afterSync,
      onError,
      cronWait
    duringMain triggers in the middle of bootstrap.
    duringSync triggers right after diffs are calculated.

    cronWait triggers while waiting for the next cron job.
    During a cron job, main() will be ran, and all hooks will be executed in order.

    please add your plugin name to any console output, see below
    if you need more data i'd be happy to help, just open an issue on the repo
    https://github.com/riki-pedia/ft-to-inv/issues
*/
// ==== please import from @riki-pedia/ft-to-inv/src/[module].js ====
//                 or just rikipedia on npmjs, @riki-pedia on github pkgs
// this isn't in the package yet, which is why we import directly
/*
 for security reasons, there is a strict 'template' to follow for plugins
 here's most of the rules:
  - every plugin must have a plugin.json file
    for example if your plugin is findable in the registry by "my-plugin", you'd need a my-plugin.json file, making sure to match the name of the dir.
    the script must also be the same name as the plugin and plugin.json file.
    you can reference plugins/example for more info
    does this sound complicated? just name all your files the same name 
    again see example dir where this file is
  - I will maintain a marketplace.json file, this is the registry of all plugins, used for the marketplace
    if you want to be in the registry, please open an issue or submit a PR here:
